# How to execute the ETL for iOMEDICO - NHL

## Prerequisites
1. Docker is installed and running.
2. The user has read access to the iOMEDICO-NHL Docker Hub repository containing the ETL image.
3. The HONEUR OMOP CDM database is running in a Docker container named `postgres`:
    * Check this by running `docker ps`. You should see the `postgres` container listed as running and healthy.
    * See [https://github.com/solventrix/Honeur-Setup/blob/master/OMOPCDM/README.md](https://github.com/solventrix/Honeur-Setup/blob/master/README.md) for more info.

## Execution steps
1. Open a terminal window 
2. Create a new directory for the ETL script execution, e.g.:
   * `mkdir etl_iomedico`
   * `cd etl_iomedico`
2. Download the installation script:
    * `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solventrix/Honeur-Setup/master/RunETLiOMEDICO_NHL/runETL.sh --output runETL.sh && chmod +x runETL.sh`
3. Execute the `runETL.sh` script by running `./runETL.sh` form inside the directory where the script is located.
4. The script will request for:
    * the path to the folder that contains the input CSV data files
    * the username and password to connect to the OMOP CDM database (a running Docker container named `postgres`)
    * the tag name for the Docker Hub image
    * the verbosity level [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR]
5. The script will run the ETL code and show the output of the code
6. The `etl.log` log file will be available in the `log` folder
