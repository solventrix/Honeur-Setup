Helper scripts combines the installation of Feder8 Components. You can choose to fully install all components or only install the essential components.

## Requirements

### Hardware
Modern 64 bit AMD dual core processor (or better)
8 GB RAM, 16 GB RAM recommended
100 GB free disk space (or more)

### Operating system
Windows 10, MacOS or Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, …)

### Docker images
The docker images required to run the full setup are located on a central repository. Make sure you have an account on our central platform before trying to run the local setup installation scripts:

  * For HONEUR: https://portal.honeur.org
  * For PHederation: https://portal.phederation.org
  * For Esfurn: https://portal.esfurn.org

Please request access by sending a mail to Michel Van Speybroeck (mvspeybr@its.jnj.com)

## Essentials
following components will be installed:
  * Postgres database v9.6.18 running on port 5444
